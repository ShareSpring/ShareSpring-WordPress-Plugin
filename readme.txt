Display a gallery of social media posts.

== Description ==
ShareSpring is a service that finds great user-generated content and embeds a beautiful gallery of the best posts onto your website.

Search for posts on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and RSS. Pick which posts to embed on your website.

Display your own posts from all of your social networks, or find public posts, or mix everything together.

== Installation ==
First, sign up for an account at sharespring.com and set up your Springboard.

In the ShareSpring dashboard, navigate to your Springboard and then Embed Code. Here you can configure the design/layout of the Springboard. Select the WordPress tab to get the shortcode to use. Add this shortcode to any page/post to embed the Springboard.

The shortcode will look something like this:
[sharespring username="<add your ShareSpring username>" stream="<add your Springboard name>"]

You can also use the widget in the same way, by adding the attributes username and stream to the widget.

If you're putting the shortcode in many places throughout your site, such as every product page of an e-commerce site, then you can enter in the default values in Settings > ShareSpring. For example, if you add your username and stream as default values here, then you don't need to include them again in the shortcode.
